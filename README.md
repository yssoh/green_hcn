## What is this

This repository contains the codes for replicating the experiments in the
paper titled:

``Energy Efficient Heterogenous Networks''

IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications (Volume: 31, Issue: 5, May 2013), DOI: 10.1109/JSAC.2013.130503

## How to run

To replicate the experiments, run the following scripts in MATLAB

* Fig1Script.m
* Fig2Script.m
* Fig3Script.m
* Fig4Script.m

You may need to run some of these scripts with modified settings in order 
to replicate the entire suite of graphs shown in the paper.  The specific
details can be found within each individual script.
